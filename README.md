# PlatScifi

A simple but challenging platformer game by the tivect team (with some silly graphics).

The game isn't finished--but it will be one day.

## Building:

CMake is required, and SFML will automatically be downloaded.

Check out `README_BuildTemplate.md` for more specific instructions

## Controls:

- `[a]`/`[d]` - move left/right

- `[w]`/`[space]` - jump

- `[s]` - fall faster

- `[r]` - reset to the spawn point

- `[p]` - spawn a bouncing ball or other object (for testing)
